## How to run locally

### Step 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Munchken105/Wayfinder.git
```

You may or may not need to ```cd``` into your repo where you cloned it.

### Step 2: From the root directory, run the commands:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

This will install the backend dependencies.

### Step 3: Start the backend.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server for the backend.

### Step 4: From the root directory, run the commands:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

This will install the frontend dependencies.

### Step 5: Start the frontend.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server for the frontend.

### Step 6: Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to open the frontend.

This should connect to the backend automatically.
